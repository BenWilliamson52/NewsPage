        <p class="article-preview">The debut album from Dublin’s Pillow Queens couldn’t be arriving at a better time. With society increasingly fractured – both by the rhetoric of division spread by our political leaders and by our current six-feet-apart reality – the underlying message that courses through ‘In Waiting’ is one of unity, community and inclusivity.<br><br>

            It’s a note that shines with positivity even on the album’s more moving tracks, the band still able to pinpoint hope in the dark. On the atmospheric, emotional indie of ‘Brothers’, the four-piece recall the loss of someone close to them (“There goes the man I want to be”). Despite the obvious sadness of the song, there’s a subtle emphasis on the importance of those left behind sticking together and holding each other up. “I love my brothers and my brothers love me,” they sing in harmony on a gently rousing chorus. “Hold up your hands, shoulder the weak.”<br><br>
            
            Meanwhile, ‘Child Of Prague’, with its melodic, chiming guitars and softly surging waves of “oohs”, presents a more stubborn approach to being by someone’s side. “Do us all a favour and forget how to speak,” Sarah Corcoran barbs, before vowing: “I’m not going if you’re not with me.”

        <p class="article-preview"> ince 2013, SOPHIE has carved out an instantly identifiable musical vernacular based on synthesized bubble sounds, brash treble, deep bass, and distended, anonymous vocals. Listening to early singles like “Lemonade” or “Vyzee” could be a disorienting (and thrilling) experience, because SOPHIE’s music sounded like a latex-coated version of radio pop: It followed many of the same rules that governed the mainstream, but all the textures were too taut, too perfect, too unreal.<br><br> But in the self-directed music video for “It’s Okay to Cry,” SOPHIE appeared in front of the lens of a camera and introduced an element of vulnerability to her work. Her own voice appeared on that track, and though still digitally altered, it sounded tentative and cracked through with subtle flaws. Finally, one of the most intriguing new presences in experimental pop had fully materialized.

            SOPHIE’s debut album, OIL OF EVERY PEARL’s UN-INSIDES, adapts many of the technical strategies heard on her previous work to looser, more sprawling compositions.
