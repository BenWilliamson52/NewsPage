            Losing sleep – insomnia epidemic being driven by pandemic </h1>

        <p class="article-preview"> it was World Sleep Day yesterday but for Ireland’s ‘3am club’, who suffer from insomnia and other sleep problems, there wasn’t much shut eye to be had.  <br><br>

            The problem of broken sleep is nothing new for Ireland’s night owls. One in five of us will suffer with sleep difficulties at some point in their lives but the Covid-19 pandemic has given rise to increased incidences of troubled sleep patterns which some victims have dubbed ‘Coronasomnia’.
            
            People have been blaming an in ability to fall asleep or get good quality slumber during the pandemic on longer screen time, a blending of day and night while working at home, poor sleep hygiene, too much blue light time and indulging in a tipple or three.<br><br>
            
            The recent AGM of the Irish Sleep Society heard of a significant increase in the number of referrals since the start of the pandemic.
            
             Dr John Garvey, consultant respiratory and sleep physician at St Vincent’s Hospital in Dublin, said: “We spend a third of our lives asleep and if there is something that is affecting that in a negative fashion, it will have consequences. People are now working from home.
            
            “Their bedroom is doubling up possibly as an office and if they actually wake up in the middle of the night, they might catch glimpse of paperwork they need to deal with the following day so it has the potential to exacerbate the problem.<br><br>
            
            “All we should do in bed is sleep or have sex and if we’re  not doing either, we should be out of bed is one of the tips you receive from sleep therapists in this regard.”
